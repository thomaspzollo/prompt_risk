      "(CNN) -- Portuguese distance runner Helder Ornelas has been handed a four-year ban after becoming the first athlete to fall foul of the IAAF's Biological Passport program. After abnormalities in his \"blood profile\" were flagged up in May 2011, the world governing body went back to scrutinize a series of blood test results for the 38-year-old between December 2009 and November 2010. Three experts in the field of haematology concluded Ornelas had used a prohibited substance or a prohibited method and the IAAF referred the case to the Portuguese Athletic Federation for adjudication. Citing \"aggravating circumstances\" the IAAF sought an increased four-year sanction despite it being a Ornelas' first doping offense. Ornelas, who won the Milan Marathon in 2005 and finished eighth in the long race at the 2001 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, did not exercise his right of appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. IAAF President Lamine Diack said: \"Those who try to cheat within the athletics community should be warned that the Athlete Biological Passport is not merely a concept but rather an efficient method to identify, target and catch those who believe that doping is the only route to success. \"Cheaters should also be aware that, if they are caught, the IAAF will seek an increased four-year sanction whenever the circumstances so justify,\" he added in a statement released Wednesday.

      "(CNN) -- They're calling it the \"Crews missile.\" Fired from the keyboard of 67-year-old Nick Crews, the missive blew the lid off his dysfunctional family. In an e-mail titled \"Dear All Three,\" published in U.K. newspaper The Telegraph, Crews excoriates his three grown children for their professional and personal failures and for the \"bitter disappointment each of you has in your own way dished out\" to him and his wife. Crews, a retired British naval officer, was fed up with his children's unsuccessful marriages and inability to earn a living that, as he said, measures up to their potential. \"I for one, and I sense Mum feels the same, have had enough of being forced to live through the never-ending bad dream of our children's underachievement and domestic ineptitudes.\" 5 ways to raise a grateful child . In the e-mail, made public with his permission by his daughter Emily, Crews describes his concern for his grandchildren. \"It makes us weak that so many of these events are copulation-driven and then helplessly to see these lovely people being so woefully let down by you, their parents.\" And then this ultimatum: \"I want to hear no more from any of you until, if you feel inclined, you have a success or an achievement or a REALISTIC plan for the support and happiness of your children to tell me about.\" Whoa. This is beyond disappointment. This sounds just plain mean. Yet, the story, and support for Crews, has gone viral. It \"struck a chord,\" wrote Telegraph reporter Cristina Odone. Sure, what parent doesn't fear raising a bum? But as the mother of two young adult children, I had to wonder whether a withering e-mail attack was the best way to go about getting the kids to shape up. I asked Dr. Gail Saltz, associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine, whether the former submarine captain took the right tack. For a parent fed up with his child's behavior, \"It can be useful to do something shocking to get someone to take it to heart,\" said Saltz. But, she added, one must pave the way long before the children became adults, with a warm, communicative relationship. Although two of his children haven't spoken to him since receiving the note, \"Crews has been swamped with encouraging messages,\" writes Odone. Many are applauding Crews for \"telling it like it is.\" But does he? In the e-mail, he alludes to his own mistakes: \"Having done our best, probably misguidedly, to provide for our children...\" He describes his envy when hearing his friends brag about their children, and seems deeply wounded by the fact that his children don't consult him or his wife before making life decisions. The secret life of my sixth grader . Perhaps he played a larger role than he would admit, or even knows, in how his children turned out. He did acknowledge to Odone that due to his naval career, he was pretty much an absentee father. The Crews story may sound frighteningly familiar to baby boomer parents. In the wake of the Great Recession, many parents have resigned themselves to the fact that their college-graduate children may not be moving out anytime soon and may not even have a job. A U.S. 2010 policy brief sponsored by Brown University showed that 43% of those under 25 live with their parents, up from 32% in 1980. But is the economy alone to blame for what I fondly call \"Deadbeat Kid Syndrome?\" \"Not everything is parenting and not everything is biology,\" said Saltz. \"There's a combination here.\" And sometimes, she added, families just have bad luck. Saltz said although Crews obviously loves his children, \"he ended up missing the mark\" with the e-mail. Still, the fact that so many are rallying to his defense can be a positive thing, Saltz said, especially in a world full of \"overly indulgent parents,\" who aren't teaching children life skills. Everyone's tweeting and boasting about their kids' successes, but missing an important point, failure is important too. \"If you don't teach your kids any resilience, you fail them out of everything,\" Saltz said. \"They need to fall down, say I fell down before but got back up, and I know I can do that.\" I'm guilty of this sort of thing. Growing up, I never once called my mother at work. Yet I allowed my own kids to call me all the time. It just took that much longer to wean them off the \"workday quickie advice call.\" Perhaps I should have let them figure out mundane daily jams on their own. Many parents have blinders on. If you don't want your kids to end up with an entitled attitude, why lambast their teachers for giving them bad grades, which they likely deserve, or for failing them for cheating? When heroes disappoint our kids . Timothy Law Snyder is vice president for academic affairs at Loyola University Maryland and lectures nationally about generational differences. Snyder says some parents blame the school or the professor, rather than the student, for bad grades, even when their child is caught plagiarizing. \"It's at its worst when the parent is living through their child,\" he said. \"The parents' successes, even life accomplishments, are identified entirely with those of their child.\" \"It used to be parents would go to the school and care that (their) kid has a moral compass and understands right and wrong,\" Saltz said. Nowadays, the concept of right and wrong isn't as clear. \"They're more concerned that the kid gets an A than be a kind person, a moral person.\" Saltz said parents are under pressure for things to look good and feel good. \"They love their children. .... But they've got tunnel vision.\" Case in point: when everyone who plays soccer gets a trophy no matter how well, or poorly, they've played. \"Children come out and experience nothing but success, not necessarily done by them but enabled by their parents, intervening all the time,\" Saltz said. Such intervention also creates a shortcut to adulthood, and that's not a good thing. Nor is having too many choices too soon. Take the beauty salon. How young is too young for a manicure? In my salon, there's a 4-year-old girl who's been getting \"mani-peds\" for two years. She loves the pedicure bath,\" the manicurist told me. What happens to that little girl when she grows up and can't afford manicures? And think, does your 6-year-old really need a cellphone? As for the Crews saga, Saltz said she hopes it makes a lot of people think about being more honest with their children. \"Someday they'll have to frustrate their child, disappoint their child, point out their child's mistakes. By doing those things earlier rather than later, they'll help their children to be better people.\" Would you write a letter like Crews' to your children?

      " Nick Crews, a retired British naval officer, wrote an explosive email to his three grown children, criticizing them for their professional and personal failures and their lack of success in life. The email, titled \"Dear All Three,\" was published in a UK newspaper and has since gone viral. Crews expresses his frustration and disappointment in his children's inability to achieve their potential and their reliance on him and his wife for financial support. He ultimatumly demands that they provide him with a plan for their happiness and success before he will continue to support them.\n",
      "Crews' harsh words have sparked a debate about the best way to raise successful children. Dr. Gail Saltz, a psychiatrist, believes that while Crews' approach may be unconventional, it can be useful to shock children into taking responsibility for their actions. However, she also notes that a warm and communicative relationship with parents is crucial in preventing the development of \"Deadbeat Kid Syndrome.\"\n",
      "The story of Nick Crews' email serves as a reminder that parents must be honest with their children about their expectations and limitations. While it may be difficult to have these conversations, they are essential in preparing children for adulthood and helping them develop the resilience and independence they need to succeed.\n",
      "In conclusion, the Nick Crews' email saga highlights the challenges of raising successful children in today's society. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to parenting, it is clear that a combination of honesty, communication, and resilience is necessary to help children reach their full potential. As a parent, would you write a letter like Crews' to your children? Do you think such a message would be effective in changing behavior? Leave your opinion in the comments section below.\n",

      "By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 09:30 EST, 20 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:43 EST, 21 August 2012 . The Tories have received hundreds of thousands of pounds from donors following controversial private dinners and parties with the Prime Minister. Latest figures reveal that £790,948 flowed into the party’s coffers from eight individuals who attended the secret Downing Street and Chequers meetings which caused a scandal earlier this year. A further £710,000 came from donors who attended ‘Leader’s Group meals’ with Mr Cameron and other senior Conservative politicians such as Home Secretary Theresa May and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. Controversial donors: Millionaires who attended private dinners with David Cameron, left, and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, right, gave £710,000 . Labour said the fact that . millionaires were donating so much money after meeting Mr Cameron showed . the rich had too much influence over the party. In a sign that the public are growing . disenchanted with politics, the amount of money donated to political . parties declined between the first and second quarters of 2012. A total . of £7,873,478 in donations was reported to the Electoral Commission . between April and June: down £992,312 on the figure for the first three . months of the year. The Conservatives accepted £3,785,579 – down by around £250,000 on the previous quarter. Labour was trailing behind on . £2,964,471; down some £450,000 on the first quarter of 2012. However, . Lib Dem donations rose slightly to £717,797. Labour backbench MP Simon Danczuk . said: ‘David Cameron’s cosy dinners in No 10 have helped the Tories rake . in hundreds of thousands from millionaire donors  in the last few . months, while over a million pounds has flooded into Tory coffers via . their exclusive Leader’s Club events where ministers rub shoulders with . only the very biggest donors. ‘With each day that passes it’s clear . that David Cameron’s Government is completely out of touch – wining and . dining the millionaires they gave a tax cut to in the Budget while . millions are paying more.’ In March, the Prime Minister was . forced to release a list of donors who had visited him at Downing Street . or his country residence, Chequers. The Electoral Commission figures . reveal that the Tories’ largest donation was £512,450 from one of those . who had been invited to Mr Cameron’s home, financier Michael Farmer. Other attendees who have donated money since the meetings were Lord . Stanley Fink (£74,000) and Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB . (£60,000). The Tories also raised hundreds of . thousands from people who attended Leader’s Group meals with senior . figures including Mr Cameron. Last night a spokesman for the Conservative Party denied that those who met the Prime Minister had influence over policy. ‘The Conservative Party continues to . enjoy a high level of financial support from generous philanthropists . committed to improving peoples’ lives across Britain,’ she said. Criticism: Nick Clegg came under attack last year after it was revealed he had dinner with Brompton's owner Rumi Verjee . ‘The Prime Minister occasionally has . dinner with party donors, as do other party leaders. There is no . suggestion of influence over government policy as a result of donations. Between them, these individuals give less than a quarter of the total . money donated to the Conservative Party.’ The spokesman pointed out that . Ed Miliband had dined with the leaders of Unite, Unison and Usdaw – . which between them gave £1,468,000 last quarter. The figures from the Electoral . Commission show that after the three main parties, the Greens came next . with £180,060 in donations. The British National Party took . £100,000 while UKIP garnered £29,370. Plaid Cymru recorded £17,500 while . the Scottish National Party only had £2,500. LABOUR is still in hock to union barons, it was claimed yesterday. Between April and June, some 70 per cent of the party’s donations – more than £2million – came from trade unions. The Conservatives said this was proof that the party was overwhelmingly reliant on the unions. However, Labour pointed out that the figures did not include revenue from ordinary members through their fees. Majority from trade unions: Since Ed Miliband became Labour leader, 81 per cent of the party's donations came from trade unions. Under Gordon Brown it was 59 per cent . The Electoral Commission report  showed that since Ed Miliband became Labour leader, 81 per cent of the party’s donations came from the trade unions. Under Gordon Brown, the figure was 59 per cent. Labour’s biggest individual donor was Unite, the union led by the militant Len McCluskey. In the previous quarter it gave over £800,000, and since Mr Miliband took over it has given more than £6million. Conservative Party co-chairman Baroness Warsi said: ‘The boss of Labour’s biggest donor is threatening British businesses with more strikes as his trade union continues its takeover of the Labour party. ‘With Labour still overwhelmingly reliant on union cash, it’s clear Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up to Len McCluskey and the other barons who anointed him Labour leader.’ Ed Miliband was only elected leader with the help of the union vote. Labour MPs and party members chose his brother, David. The figures show that Labour received £2.96million in public donations, of which £2.07million came from the unions. Unite gave £840,725 – in itself a massive 28 per cent of total donations. It was the largest single donation to any party. Labour received £429,558 from the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers; and £313,863 from the GMB. Another £213,000 came from Unison. A Labour source said it was wrong to suggest that the unions had undue influence over the party leadership. ‘We welcome the unions’ support but it would be wrong to suggest that in any way it gains them undue influence over policy or that they are the sole source of the party’s funding,’ he added. A Unite spokesman said trade union donations were among the ‘cleanest money in politics’ and are transparently given. [/INST]\n",

      " The article discusses the latest donation figures for the UK's three main political parties: the Conservatives, Labour, and the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives have received hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations from donors who attended private dinners with Prime Minister David Cameron, while Labour has received the majority of its donations (70%) from trade unions. The article also mentions that the Liberal Democrats saw a slight increase in donations. The Conservatives have been criticized for the large amount of money they have received from millionaires, while Labour has been accused of being too reliant on union donations. The article quotes a Labour spokesperson as saying that the party welcomes union support but denies that it gives undue influence over party leadership.\n",

      "By . Joani Walsh . PUBLISHED: . 17:13 EST, 28 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:41 EST, 29 October 2013 . With a supermodel daughter, it is natural to assume that Valerie Campbell would be as looks-obsessed as the modelling industry. Yet when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in her right breast and underwent a mastectomy, Valerie, 61, decided against the reconstructive surgery that might have maintained her perfect figure. 'After what I’d been through, my looks weren’t important,’ says Valerie, who lives in Surrey. 'When you’re staring into the chasm between life and death, you put things into perspective and whether I was left with one arm, one eye or one breast, staying alive was what mattered. Glamorous: Naomi Campbell and mother Valerie after the latter's operation . 'I didn’t have concerns about reconstructive surgery - that’s not why I turned it down - but it was unnecessary to me; my legs are more important to how I feel about my appearance than my breasts - and it wasn’t worth the risk, or physical trauma. Besides, I’m scared of needles.’ Eight years after Valerie’s diagnosis, she has no regrets - although friends and family are still surprised by it. 'Even now Naomi rings me up and says, “Mum, why don’t you have a reconstruction?”. I think my daughter worries that’s the reason I’m on my own, that maybe I’m scared of intimacy. But it couldn’t be further from the truth. 'I can live without my breast. It hasn’t changed my character or affected my body image. I still wear low-cut tops and swimming costumes - I use prosthetics. If I’m not bothered about what my chest looks like, why should a man? If someone comes along who’s right for me, he won’t care.’ Valerie is not alone in deciding against reconstructive surgery after mastectomy. Around 17,000 women a year have a mastectomy, but only a quarter have reconstructive surgery, according to the National Mastectomy and Breast Reconstruction Audit of England and Wales published last year. The majority of reconstructions are performed at the same time as surgery to remove the cancer. Women who wait often want time to accept their diagnosis and its impact on their self-image. Mother-daughter duo (pictured in 1992): 'You don't argue with Naomi,' laughs Valerie about her daughter's insistence she be seen by a specialist in the U.S. But most breast cancer patients never have a reconstruction. 'In specialist centres that offer reconstruction routinely and have access to highly trained surgeons, only about 40 to 50 per cent of women have one,’ says Fiona MacNeill, consultant breast surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital, West London. Ms MacNeill says that women often find their daughters are the ones encouraging them to have reconstructions. 'The daughters are usually transferring feelings about their own self-image - they’re sure they would choose one so think it must be right for their mother,’ says Ms MacNeill. 'Women have different relationships with their breasts throughout their lives. A lot of older women, particularly mothers, see their breasts as functional and now they’ve served their purpose are less affected by their loss, while younger women are more likely to have reconstructions.’ A reconstruction is major surgery and can take three months to recover from, which also puts women off, she adds. 'Their breasts are never going to look, feel or have the same sensation as before treatment. Some patients take pride in their scars and see them as a sign of winning a battle.’ Others may see their breasts as a threat that could potentially kill them, so are not concerned about losing them. 'If I’m not bothered about what my chest . looks like, why should a man? If someone comes along who’s right for me, . he won’t care.’ 'As long as they’re fully informed about options, women tend to make the best decisions for themselves,’ adds Ms MacNeill. Therein lies a problem, as many women are not fully informed about their options, says Joe O’Donoghue, plastic surgeon and British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons member, who co-authored the audit. Lack of awareness of the options and access to specialist plastic surgeons play a significant role in the low rates of reconstructions. The audit found more than a third of women surveyed said the risks and benefits of reconstruction were never discussed. Options include an implant-based reconstruction, or a tissue reconstruction that involves skin, fat and muscle grafting. Reconstructive surgery is not risk-free - 35 five per cent of women who have implant reconstructions undergo a 'revision’ operation within five years due to problems, including capsular contracture (when tissue forms around the implant, causing hardness and pain) - or asymmetry. 'The surviving breast will naturally age, while the implant hasn’t,’ explains Mr O’Donoghue. This problem is avoided with a tissue reconstruction as the breast ages the same way as the other breast and changes size, but the surgery is longer, more complex, and leaves scars. Valerie had an advanced invasive ductal carcinoma - cancer affecting the cells lining the milk ducts. She had felt a lump while bathing and was soon referred to the Mayday Hospital in Croydon, Surrey. She was given a biopsy and then the shocking news that she had cancer, and it had spread to her lymph nodes. Like daughter, like mother: Valerie, pictured on the catwalk, joins many other women in refusing reconstructive surgery . 'My younger sister, Yvonne, who came with me to get the diagnosis, was bawling her eyes out, but it felt like the doctor was talking to someone else. All I heard was “cancer” and “advanced”.’ Delivering the news to her children Pierre, then 21 and training to be an actor in New York, and Naomi, then 35, who was working in Europe, was emotional. 'Everyone cried but me - I was shell-shocked.’ But Valerie remained positive. 'I said to Naomi: “Wherever this has come from, it’s going right back,” and she said she knew I’d be fine.’ Naomi insisted Valerie got a second opinion from a specialist in the U.S. 'You don’t argue with Naomi,’ Valerie laughs. Valerie, who by now had been referred to the Royal Marsden, immediately started chemotherapy to shrink the tumour, before doctors decided that Valerie should have a mastectomy. Valerie was also seeing specialists at the Mayo Clinic Cancer Centre in the U.S. and she opted to have the surgery - removing her breast and affected lymph nodes - there. 'Naomi arranged an apartment for me near the Mayo Clinic while I recuperated.’ Valerie stayed there for three months while undergoing radiotherapy. Back in the UK, Valerie started hormone therapy with the drug anastrozole, which stops the production of oestrogen and cuts the risk of breast cancer recurring. Valerie took anastrozole for seven years, but stopped because of the side-effects. 'It made me so puffy I couldn’t see my cheekbones, I was bloated, tired, moody, had pins and needles - you name it.’ Her regular check-ups ended after five years, and she now has the three-yearly mammograms that are offered by the NHS. 'I’ve been free of cancer so long I don’t think about it any more. Now I see and appreciate the detail in life, as if someone’s turned up the colour. I’ve found myself again and I want other women going through it to know that’s possible - with or without your breasts.’ Valerie Campbell is working on a natural skincare line with Perfect Look & Health products, which will donate 20 per cent of profits from sales of products during October to breast cancer research: lookandhealth.co.uk .

      " Valerie Campbell, a 61-year-old woman from Surrey, England, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and underwent a mastectomy. Despite her daughter Naomi Campbell's insistence that she undergo reconstructive surgery, Valerie decided against it. She chose to live without her breast and instead focus on her overall health and well-being.\n",
      "Valerie's decision not to have reconstructive surgery was influenced by her personal beliefs and experiences. She believed that her looks were not as important as her health and well-being, and she did not want to risk undergoing major surgery and spending months recovering. Additionally, she was concerned about the potential side effects of reconstructive surgery, such as capsular contracture and asymmetry.\n",
      "Valerie's decision to not have reconstructive surgery is not unique. According to the National Mastectomy and Breast Reconstruction Audit of England and Wales, only a quarter of women who undergo mastectomy have reconstructive surgery. Many women choose to live without their breasts, either because they do not see the need for reconstruction or because they are concerned about the risks and complications associated with the surgery.\n",
      "Valerie's story highlights the importance of informed decision-making when it comes to breast cancer treatment. Many women are not fully informed about their options, including the risks and benefits of reconstructive surgery. Lack of awareness and access to specialist plastic surgeons can also play a significant role in the low rates of reconstructions.\n",
      "In conclusion, Valerie Campbell's decision not to have reconstructive surgery after her mastectomy is a personal choice that reflects her values and beliefs. Her story serves as a reminder that women have the right to make informed decisions about their health and well-being, and that there are alternative options available for those who do not want to undergo reconstructive surgery.\n",

      "Labour and disability charities are facing a growing public backlash for making a ‘disgusting spectacle’ of remarks by a Government minister about minimum pay for disabled workers. Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle looked shocked as a BBC Question Time audience turned on her when she demanded that welfare reform minister Lord Freud should resign or be sacked. She insisted the peer had been ‘offensive’ in remarks secretly recorded by a Labour official at a fringe meeting of last month’s Conservative Party conference. Scroll down for video . Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle on Question Time when she demanded Lord Freud be sacked . Lord Freud was responding to a councillor with a severely disabled daughter who suggested that people with mental health problems may be unable to work because employers are unwilling to pay them the statutory minimum. Lord Freud suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‘not worth’ the £6.50 minimum wage and mused on whether the Government might be able to top up their wages to enable more to get into workplaces. Labour leader Ed Miliband ambushed David Cameron with a transcript of the recording at Prime Minister’s Questions this week, also insisting the minister should be sacked. He has remained in his job after apologising, but Miss Eagle insisted on Thursday night: ‘I do think he should resign. I think what he said… has caused a great deal of offence to disabled people. ‘There are 50 per cent of people with disabilities who are not in work at the moment. The answer to that isn’t to somehow weaken the minimum wage and make them work for less than the minimum wage.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on the programme it was clear Lord Freud had been talking about the state ‘topping up’ the incomes of disabled people. Lord Freud suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‘not worth’ the £6.50 minimum wage . One audience member agreed: ‘I think Angela Eagle is being extremely disingenuous. I think we all knew what he meant, even though he said it clumsily.’ Another person in the audience in Newbury, Berkshire, told Miss Eagle: ‘What you are doing is hypocritical point scoring and it’s disgusting.’ A young woman said: ‘I just wanted to see whether you [Eagle] would use this as a political football and you have done – thanks Angela.’ Yesterday a Conservative MP also defended Lord Freud, insisting that the minimum wage was having a detrimental impact on disabled people’s chances of finding work. Jackie Doyle-Price, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said the way Lord Freud’s remarks had been twisted by Labour and parts of the charitable sector was ‘frankly disgusting’. It emerged the charity Mencap, which has led criticism of Lord Freud, itself warned an estimated 1,000 people with severe learning disabilities had part-time jobs or had their working hours cut as a direct result of the national minimum wage. In 2000, it called for an urgent revision of the rules to enable ‘low output work’ to be exempted from the rules. It now says the system to support disabled people into work has been transformed in the last 15 years and debate has moved on, ‘as has our position’. Conservative MP Henry Smith said: ‘Certain charities have seemed quick to make political attacks on what is a very serious and complex issue. Charities should not be acting as mouthpieces for Labour’s political point scoring.’ Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit, whose wife Margaret was badly disabled in the Brighton bomb, said the attacks on Lord Freud were a ‘disgusting spectacle’. ‘What Lord Freud was being asked about was whether there are handicapped people who cannot produce enough to justify in purely economic terms a wage of £6 an hour. My wife was capable of earning her pay as an experienced nurse until the sadistic criminals of IRA/Sinn Fein crippled her. She is worth no less today, but she could not justify a pay rate of £6 an hour. Lord Freud was mulling over how to help such people.’ Labour's Department for Trade and Industry published guidance in 2003 on when and where it might be acceptable to pay disabled people far less than the minimum wage. The department, then run by Patricia Hewitt, said the minimum wage applied to all workers – able-bodied or disabled. However, disabled people could be exempted from the minimum wage when they did work-related activity for therapeutic reasons, with no contractual obligation to work. The guidance gave various examples of when that could apply, after the Government consulted with organisations including Scope, Mencap and the TUC. It gave the example of a farm where people develop social skills through involvement in agriculture, horticulture, caring for animals and training. Other examples included a charity running a workshop for people with mental health problems, which it suggested, could pay them as little as £4 per day. A third example was a trust running a facility for mental health outpatients which does activities such as packing and assembly. They could be paid varying amounts up to just £20 per week.

      " The article discusses a controversy surrounding a comment made by a Government minister, Lord Freud, at a fringe meeting of the Conservative Party conference. Lord Freud suggested that some disabled workers may be seen as \"not worth\" the minimum wage of £6.50 per hour, and mused about whether the government might be able to top up their wages to enable more to get into workplaces. This comment sparked outrage among disability charities and Labour politicians, who demand that Lord Freud resign or be sacked. Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle demanded that Lord Freud be sacked during a BBC Question Time appearance, insisting that his remarks have caused a great deal of offense to disabled people. Labour leader Ed Miliband also ambushed Prime Minister David Cameron with a transcript of the recording at Prime Minister's Questions. However, some audience members at the BBC program defended Lord Freud, with one person suggesting that Eagle was being hypocritical and politically motivated. Conservative MP Jackie Doyle-Price also defended Lord Freud, arguing that the minimum wage was having a detrimental impact on disabled people's chances of finding work. The article also mentions that charities such as Mencap have warned that the national minimum wage has led to 1,000 people with severe learning disabilities having their working hours cut or part-time jobs. The article concludes that the controversy has highlighted the complex and serious issue of how to support disabled people into work, and that charities should not be acting as mouthpieces for political point scoring.\n",

      "(CNN) -- Investigators and community members in Tennessee continued their hunt Sunday for a 20-year-old nursing student, offering a fresh appeal for tips on the man they believe forcibly took her from her home last week. Holly Bobo was on her way to school when her brother saw her being led from their Darden, Tennessee, home into the woods by a man wearing camouflage, said John Mehr, special agent in charge for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Mehr's state agency urged people Sunday \"to take notice of anyone whose whereabouts were unaccounted for Wednesday morning, when Holly went missing, and changes in behavior since the incident.\" Police have not yet named anyone who they believe was behind the alleged kidnapping. \"It's possible the suspect missed work or appointments last Wednesday, Thursday or Friday unexpectedly,\" the bureau of investigation said in a statement. \"He may also have excessively cleaned a car or ATV, suddenly sold a vehicle, or reported it stolen. The suspect may be showing signs of anxiety or stress.\" The community, which is near Parsons, is offering $25,000 for information that helps authorities locate Bobo and/or arrest her alleged abductor. While authorities have backed away from their earlier assertion that Bobo was dragged away, they do not believe she went willingly either. \"We feel she was in fear of her life so she was compliant with his demands,\" Mehr has said. As of Sunday, the investigative bureau said law enforcement had gotten more than 250 leads. Search teams were combing for evidence in parts of Decatur and Henderson counties, including in Natchez State Park. On Saturday, the state agency had said teams were looking in parts of Henry, Carroll and Benton counties. Decatur County Mayor Michael Smith told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Friday that new evidence had been found in the search for Bobo, who was taking nursing classes at a Tennessee Technology Center campus in Parsons. Smith wouldn't elaborate on what type of evidence was found, but CNN has learned that a white lunch box was found near a creek eight miles away. Bobo is 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs about 110 pounds. She was last seen wearing a pink shirt and light blue jeans. The case has galvanized many in the rural central Tennessee community, which is roughly halfway between Memphis and Nashville. Hundreds of volunteers -- some on horseback and foot, others on all-terrain vehicles -- have turned out in recent days to hunt for clues, while many more have attended memorial services or offered supportive thoughts online via several groups on Facebook. \"We're just all close,\" one volunteer, Bryan Smith, told CNN affiliate KSMV. \"Everybody's close in this town and the county.\" Her parents, meanwhile, have struggled to come to grips with their daughter's disappearance. Her mother, Karen Bobo, cried throughout her husband's brief statement to reporters Thursday and then spoke directly to Holly and whoever might know what has become of her. \"Holly, I love you so much. Please try to get home to us.\" Karen Bobo said. \"She's ... so precious, you just don't even know. I just want her back.\" [/INST]\n",

      "By . Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . A restaurant owner has caused outrage by telling customers they can no longer share meals when in large groups and demanded they order individual dishes and drinks. Martin Duncan, owner of Freestyle Tout, which boasts the 'best desserts in Brisbane, took to Facebook on Monday to inform patrons of the rules during peak business times - but his post sparked anger among some regulars. 'We would really really appreciate each individual guest purchasing a meal or dessert and a beverage,' he wrote. Freestyle Tout owner Martin Duncan has caused controversy by demanding all customers order something when they visit his cafe . 'We would like to reserve table space for paying customers. 'Sorry to put it plainly but large groups not eating or drinking does not pay our rent or the wages of our fabulous staff. If you must share please purchase a drink.' But some diners were not happy with being told what to do and said the business would lose customers if they weren't more welcoming. One diner responded: 'Don't tell me what to do Freestyle? I will purchase what I want! What an absolute joke! This guy is going to lose all his business'. 'I always share a dessert when I go places simply because I can't eat that much food. I don't think it's healthy or fair to force people to eat when they are not hungry. It's such a waste of money for me to eat a meal and send half of it back when I go out, so my partner and I usually share,' another patron wrote. Others were more supportive of the new move. 'It is a reasonable request, I am with the owners,' one person said. The Brisbane restaurant is urging diners to order their own food and beverages instead of sharing meals . Following the reaction, Mr Duncan said his message may have been a 'little misconstrued'. 'To help set the record straight there are no \"rules\" regarding dining at Freestyle Tout,' he wrote in a latter post. 'There is no issue with people sharing meals, after all, the sharing of food is one of life's great joys.' But Mr Duncan continued to explain the reasoning behind his original plea. 'The issue I am speaking out about is when large groups of say, 10 or 20 people share for instance, 2 meals/desserts, or share 4 coffees or even worse, try bringing in their own food from home, especially when there are customers waiting for a seat,' he wrote. 'This is an issue not just limited to our business, many of my fellow restaurateurs have shared similar stories with me. 'Many people are watching their pennies in this economy and this is understandable. Our meals start at $8.90 and that's why we try and make dining out an affordable experience for all.' Diners at Freestyle Tout, a Brisbane dessert cafe, are being urged to stop sharing meals . Owner Martin Duncan took to Facebook again to clarify the new changes to his restaurant . The eatery claims to have the 'best desserts' in Brisbane . [/INST]\n",

      "Premier League matches will be played on Friday nights from summer 2016 under the next TV deal but the Mail on Sunday can reveal that another more radical proposal — league games played overseas — will not happen for the foreseeable future. Fan power has seen the idea shelved, perhaps for good. The Premier League’s chief executive Richard Scudamore wants overseas games to happen, following the lead of the most lucrative sports league in the world, the NFL. Most of the Premier League’s clubs, led by the major foreign-owned sides, want them to happen. Meaningful games in foreign host cities could earn tens of millions per match. But home-based supporters’ opposition seems to have kiboshed the notion. Premier League stars such as Oliver Giroud (above) are set to be a hit around the world . The Premier League’s chief executive Richard Scudamore (centre) wants overseas games to happen . Sergio Aguero, November's Premier League player of the month, could now be scoring goals on a Friday . ‘The clubs are keen for us to keep developing the concept but we’re no nearer,’ said Scudamore, who first proposed in 2008 that a ‘39th game’ be played abroad each year, in an exclusive interview. ‘The idea of an extra game is gone. Whether you play a regular season game (overseas), that has challenges, not least among the fans, which we take into consideration. ‘I’ve never shied away from the fact that personally I think it’s a good idea. I bear the scars from thinking it’s a good idea. A lot of the clubs think it’s a good idea... but there is absolutely no time line and no idea when it might happen.’ Asked to confirm that an overseas game will not happen foreseeably, in the next TV round and before 2020 at the earliest, Scudamore said: ‘You can make that assumption.’ Sky Sports have the rights to 116 games this season, and that number could go up with the new deal . The Premier League tender document for UK live TV rights for 2016-19 is just dropping on the desks of senior executives at major broadcasters. The Premier League will sell 168 live games per season to UK television from 2016-17 to 2018-2019, up from 154 games now. Those games will be sold in seven packages, five of 28 games and two of 14 per year, and about 10 games per season will be on Friday nights. No buyer will be allowed more than 126 games per season. The Premier League currently make £3.018billion from Sky and BT for domestic live rights for 2013-16 and about £2.9bn more combined from foreign live rights (£2.2bn), highlights, near-live rights and mobile clip rights. These massive sums flow to the clubs, who in turn spend it buying and paying big-name players, most of them foreign, and therefore attractive to global audiences. So a ‘virtuous circle’ of growth continues. BT Sport caused a shock with the previous deal when they paid almost £6.5m per game in 2013 . The Premier League will soon boast the second biggest annual income from broadcast rights in the world, according to a report from industry specialists TV Sports Markets. The English top flight currently sits in third place, behind the figures for American football and baseball in the US. But the next TV deal could soar to £7.5bn between 2016-19, an annual income of £2.5bn, which would take the Premier League second. And 38 per cent of the League’s broadcast income is from overseas, already the highest ratio by far in the world. 1 NFL £4.14billion . (American football income from broadcast rights in 2014) 2 MLB £1.94billion . (American baseball) 3 Premier League £1.91billion . (Domestic and overseas income) 4 NBA £1.21billion . (American basketball) 5 Champions League . 6 Serie A . 7 Olympics . 8 NHL . 9 Ligue 1 (France) 10 La Liga (Spain) Analysts and insiders have contrasting views of how much these deals could grow but everyone agrees they will grow. It would be no surprise to see the total three-year pot soar from £5.9bn to £7.5bn, and if major new players such as Qatar-owned beIN SPORTS come to the table for the UK rights, as long suggested, it could yet be more. The Premier League’s global appeal is being highlighted this weekend at ‘BPL Live’, a huge public event in Mumbai, India, where 20,000 fans from the sub-continent are gathering in a public park, essentially to watch Premier League matches on a big screen. Yesterday they watched Chelsea play Hull on one screen and Leicester host Manchester City on another. Today they will be treated to Manchester United against Liverpool. There is also a tented village where fans can be photographed with the Premier League trophy, visit exhibitions by the League’s clubs and meet a range of ‘legends’ including former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler. Vijay Kuppili, a 30-year-old manager with an online company, has made a two-hour flight from his home town in south-east India specifically to attend BPL Live this weekend. ‘I’ve been following the Premier League for 10 years, since Arsenal’s Invincibles,’ he said, although he is a Manchester United fan, through admiration of Sir Alex Ferguson’s management and teams. He and college mates, variously fans of United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, watched whatever games they could as students in their communal digs, and remain hard-core fans today. Interest has also soared again in the past year, he says, because the coverage within India has improved, with more games and higher broadcasting standards. The NFL has made lucrative sums of money by staging a host of games at Wembley Stadium . Colin Kaepernick scores a touchdown for the San Francisco 49s against Jacksonville Jaguars in London . That can be explained by STAR TV’s investment. The rights holders on the sub-continent paid £93m for their current three-year rights, up from £29m previously. They have also invested in new commentators, some of them trained in England by veterans including Sky’s Martin Tyler, and now offer games in multiple languages. ‘Football is an aspirational sport and India has a committed fan following for the Barclays Premier League,’ said STAR’s chief operating officer, Sanjay Gupta. ‘BPL Live is a great initiative to take fans closer to the game, its iconic clubs and legendary heroes.’ Schmeichel, in Mumbai to help promote the event, said interest in the Premier League in India is ‘massive’. He has also travelled extensively as a United ambassador and adds: ‘Every time I go somewhere I’m still genuinely taken aback at how big United are.’ Champions Manchester City are set for Premier League games on a Friday night under a new rights package . Yesterday he went to the Leicester City tent at BPL Live to have a FaceTime chat with his son Kasper, Leicester’s goalkeeper, back home. ‘I was surprised to see how many people were in there, the interest here is in the League as a whole, not just one club,’ Schmeichel Snr said. ‘There are people in Chelsea shirts, and United, Liverpool, but also Leicester and other clubs.’ Scudamore sees India as one of eight key ‘strategic’ international markets where the rights values can soar in the 2016-19 sales round. The USA and China are also in that bracket. ‘The size of the market, the potential growth in the market and also the appetite of local partners to develop that market — when you get those three things coming together, that’s what determines it,’ he explained. He knows that the League is most likely to see a surge in TV income in any market, domestic or foreign, where two or more rival broadcasters both desperately want the rights. Chelsea fans sing during the Barclays Premier League 'Live' event in Mumbai, India . ‘Growth tends to be driven, historically, by competitive tension,’ he said. ‘Where there is competitive tension our rights grow and where there isn’t any they tend not to grow. Therefore it’s difficult to forecast. But do I see headroom? Yes. Do I see growth? Yes.’ Independent analysts agree. Kevin McCullagh of industry specialists TV Sports Markets, said: ‘The Premier League’s international rights value is the envy of sports properties around the world, including the biggest US leagues such as the NFL, MLB, and NBA. ‘There is still room for growth in Premier League international rights values. Crucially, it is popular in many regions with growing pay-television industries, such as in Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Latin America. Pay-television has been the big driver of sports rights values around the world. It is also benefiting from the rise of football in the US — football rights fees have been growing strongly there in recent years.’ [/INST]\n",
      "\n",
      " The Premier League is set to continue its growth and success, with a new TV deal worth £7.5 billion ($10.6 billion) over three years, making it the second-highest annual income from broadcast rights in the world. The league is expanding its international reach, with games played in foreign host cities and a growing fan base in countries such as India. However, the idea of overseas games played by Premier League teams has been shelved for the foreseeable future, due to opposition from home-based supporters. The league's chief executive, Richard Scudamore, remains optimistic about the league's growth potential, citing the league's global appeal and the increasing popularity of football in the US. The current TV deal includes 168 live games per season, with 38% of the league's broadcast income coming from overseas. The league is also set to benefit from the investment of new broadcasters in India, who have paid £93 million for their current three-year rights, up from £29 million previously.\n",

      "A man behind a controversial revenge porn site has asked Google to remove links to stories critical of his seedy business from their search results. Craig Brittain, whose website posted nude photos of women without their knowledge or permission, is seeking the removal of the articles on the grounds that they feature pictures of him that were used without his consent. The 28-year-old's now defunct site, Isanybodydown.com,also allegedly charged a 'take-down' fee for victims who want their photos removed. Craig Brittain, 28, who was behind a controversial revenge porn site, has asked Google to remove links to stories critical of his seedy business . The site was banned from posting or sharing revenge porn photos or video by America's Federal Trade Commission earlier this year. Brittain sent a Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) take down to Google objecting to 23 articles remaining in their search rankings, according to the Daily Mirror. In the notice, which is published online, he claims that images, statements and other identity information was used in the stories without his permission. He states that it came from isanybodydown.com and his Facebook page. The DMCA notice was received on February 9, but at present no action has been taken by Google. The DMCA is a US law that was created in 1998 to protect against copyright infringements. Brittain was alleged to have used 'deception to acquire and post intimate images of women' for isanybodydown.com, according to the FTC complaint. Posing as a woman, he reportedly used websites such as Craigslist to obtain explicit photos, offering nude photos of himself in exchange. Men were also said to have given him photos of naked women, as a way to take revenge for being spurned. The FTC says his site featured images of more than 1,000 people and he made about $12,000 while it was up and running. Isanybodydown.com was banned from publishing nude pictures without the consent of the subject last month . Last month Brittain agreed to not publish any nude pictures without the consent of the subject and to destroy his collection, the FTC said. Speaking after the decision Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection said: 'This behavior is not only illegal but reprehensible. 'I am pleased that as a result of this settlement, the illegally collected images and information will be deleted.' In a statement posted on the website after it was closed down Brittain of Colorado said: 'I want to apologize to those who were affected by Is Anybody Down. 'I made a series of poor decisions, then tried to rationalize them, and made it even worse. 'I am sorry for the damage that I caused to everyone that ended up on my website. ' I am making amends at every opportunity. I regularly volunteer for, and donate to charitable organizations (I encourage you to do the same!). 'I ask for your forgiveness. What I did was wrong.'

      " The document reports on a man named Craig Brittain, who ran a controversial revenge porn website called Isanybodydown.com. Brittain has requested that Google remove links to articles critical of his business, citing copyright infringement. However, the articles in question feature pictures of Brittain himself, which he claims were used without his consent. The website was banned from publishing nude pictures without consent last month, and Brittain has agreed to delete his collection of illegally obtained images. Despite this, he has continued to seek removal of the critical articles from Google's search results. The article highlights the illegal and unethical nature of Brittain's actions, as well as his attempts to cover them up. It also notes that he has made amends by volunteering and donating to charitable organizations.\n",

      "ANDORRA LA VELLA, Andorra (CNN)  -- Getting to Andorra, a tiny country wedged in the mountains between France and Spain, is no easy feat. No airport, no train station, and the nearest city Toulouse is at least a 2 hour drive away. Andorra, a beautiful mini-country in the Pyrenees, offers its residents a peaceful life. Perhaps that's part of the secret of this tiny principality high up in the Pyrenees Mountains: that its quiet isolation has created a relatively stress-free life-style which has made them the world champions in the global longevity sweepstakes, at least according to the latest U.S. Census Department estimates. The average Andorran today can expect to live at least 85 years -- longer than anywhere else on the planet. Meeting Andorrans from all walks of life, it soon becomes clear that the concept of living longer was not on everyone's mind, but the idea of living well and living healthy came up in nearly every conversation. From doctors in town to the elderly shepherd in the mountains, they speak of eating good natural food and of the exercise which comes naturally in walking up and down the hillsides. Dr. Albert Font, Director of Andorra's Geriatric Clinic, is convinced that living in the mountains is, in general, healthier both for mind and body: \"It's because we have this natural environment that we have such a balanced health,\" he told CNN. Watch a report on the secrets of long life in Andorra » . Elderly Andorrans have a daily routine that would put much younger people in the shade: outside their Assisted Living Residence, a group of about 30 senior citizens in their 80's and 90's out for a cold morning's walk went slowly but surely and easily negotiated two or three flights of stairs built into the mountainside. After that 'warm-up' most of them headed for the gym for stationary bike riding and exercise class. Diet and nutrition awareness also seems to play a role in keeping Andorrans alive and healthy. Nestled in valleys between France and Spain, there is very little cultivatable land and strangely enough, tobacco seems to be one of the few crops raised on the little farmland in the country. But meat, vegetables and fish from its larger neighbors make their way to the dinner tables in Andorra, resulting in a high-altitude version of the Mediterranean diet so many strive for elsewhere. But even in this land-locked little country, times are changing and the older generation worries that the slow invasion of fast food and the passivity of video games and the like, may have a negative impact on the life expectancy of the young. Seventy-six-year old farmer Pierre Font Vergas remembers the days when just taking his herd of cattle to pastures and back home again would easily mean hiking 30 kilometers (18 miles) up and down the mountain trails each day. A new lifestyle has come to the principality, the old farmer told CNN. Skiing and tourism are the country's new profit centers, life is getting increasingly stressful, more people are eating fast food instead of the traditional diet and not getting enough exercise, he added. It would seem that the secrets to long life in Andorra are not really secrets at all. They are well documented. Good health care, clean water, proper diet, plenty of exercise and a low-stress, positive life . However, there's one other thing to consider when trying to understand the Andorran's penchant for life and living long: the feeling of community and an unusual closeness to friends and family. Filming at an elderly care home, it was full of families including young children spending an hour or two on a weekday with an aged parent or grandparent. And even to stop to ask a question or a direction, people seemed to know about everything and everyone else in the country. Some might find that intrusive, or even boring. But there seemed to be a marked sense of peace in the way people here see life. Dr. Font thinks there is a specific reason for that sense of happiness in Andorra: \"We don't have any violence. I think it's one of the safest countries in the world.\" \"And after all,\" one Andorran told CNN, \"unlike the rest of Europe, we haven't been touched by a war in more than 700 years.\" [/INST]\n",

      " The document highlights the secrets of long life in Andorra, a small country nestled in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain. Andorra's residents have an average life expectancy of 85 years, making it the world champion in longevity. The article attributes this to several factors:\n",
      "1. Good healthcare: Andorra has a well-developed healthcare system, which contributes to its residents' longevity.\n",
      "2. Clean water: The country's natural springs and rivers provide clean drinking water, essential for good health.\n",
      "3. Proper diet: Andorrans follow a Mediterranean diet rich in meat, vegetables, and fish from neighboring countries. This diet, combined with a lack of cultivatable land, means that tobacco is one of the few crops grown in the country.\n",
      "4. Exercise: The country's mountainous terrain encourages physical activity, and many Andorrans engage in outdoor activities such as hiking and skiing.\n",
      "5. Low stress: Andorra's peaceful and isolated location, combined with a strong sense of community, contributes to a low-stress lifestyle.\n",
      "6. Good nutrition: The country's diet is rich in nutrients, and the lack of fast food and processed food means that residents tend to eat healthier than in other parts of Europe.\n",
      "7. Sense of community: Andorrans have a strong sense of belonging and close relationships with family and friends, which contributes to their overall well-being.\n",
      "8. Safe environment: Andorra is one of the safest countries in the world, with no history of war in over 700 years. This peaceful environment likely contributes to the residents' stress-free lifestyle.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the secrets to long life in Andorra are: good healthcare, clean water, proper diet, plenty of exercise, low stress, good nutrition, a strong sense of community, and a safe environment. These factors combined contribute to the country's high life expectancy and overall well-being of its residents.\n",

      "Every five minutes a woman in India is compelled to visit a police station and report a case of cruelty -- usually one committed by her own husband or family. Every ten minutes a woman in India reports assault. Every 21 minutes one of them reports a rape. The numbers are no secret: you can do the math from the National Crime Records Bureau yourself. The total number of these assorted cases has increased in each of the last five documented years, making for a 25% jump over this period. But the numbers don't tell the complete truth. At the very least, they are frequently misrepresented. With each high profile rape in India -- sensationally reported in national and sometimes international media -- the increased number of reported crimes is cited as an example of how the incidence rape in India is on a steep upward curve. But it's a lazy correlation. In reality, we don't really know that the number of cases of rape are on the rise. All we know is that more women are reporting these crimes -- perhaps, in part, because of the spotlight on them. Either way, the number of women not reporting rapes and other crimes is a far bigger statistic -- many are undocumented, brushed under the carpet, forgotten. Gender gap . How do we explain why India has so many cases? There are likely a number of complex sociological factors but there's not much hard data. One useful indicator of the safety of Indian women is to look at how they compare globally on freedom. The World Economic Forum's new Gender Gap Index gives India a dismal scorecard -- worse than in previous years. India's women rank 134th in the world (out of 142 countries) for economic opportunities; they place 126th in the world for educational attainment; 141st in the world for health and survival. These are all basic rights that would empower them, make them less likely to be silent victims. SURVEY: Women earn much less than men generally . The only parameter India performs well on is on having a female head of state or government, where it ranks a surprising first. But the parameter itself is flawed. In 15 of the 21 years the study counts, Indira Gandhi was prime minister. History will hardly portray Gandhi's achievements as solely a triumph for Indian women; her victory and the length of her rule was also a triumph of her lineage (Gandhi's father was Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister. She shared no relation to the legendary Mahatma Gandhi, but her surname -- acquired through marriage -- didn't hurt.) A more reliable indicator of the political empowerment of India's women is how it places 111th in the world for electing female parliamentarians, and 107th in the world for voting in female ministers. Born at a disadvantage . Why the sorry state of India's women? Why are they so far behind? The sad reality is that it begins before women are even born. According to India's census, there are 940 women for every 1,000 men. In part, the difference exists because of decades of female infanticide -- the practice where families abort fetuses on discovering their sex. When girls are born, they're born with the promise of a second class life. While men enjoy a literacy rate of 82%, only 65% of Indian women can read or write. Girls in India have long been considered a burden, a cause for losing money in marriages and dowries. Data and anecdotes alike show that Indian women have been unwanted and unloved for decades. Consider how families pressure their daughters-in-law for baby boys, not girls. Consider how in rural India, many Indian parents mistreat their daughters-in-law, demanding dowries, mothers-in-law meting out the same discrimination they were once subjected to. An overwhelming 43% of crimes reported by Indian women are acts of cruelty committed by their own families. Millions of Indians -- men and women -- are complicit. The discrimination continues at a policy level: marital rape is still not considered a crime in India. Local governments and police remain poorly equipped to process crimes against women -- let alone doing so in a sensitive manner. So why are many shocked by India's abysmal statistics on crimes against women? The crimes, as always, begin at home. It should be no surprise to read about the physical crimes reported and recorded by the National Crime Records Bureau. What is surprising is how generations of Indians have stood by as their mothers, sisters, and daughters have been left behind on every indicator of quality of life; they have been denied the chance for basic equality. The WEF report makes for illuminating reading, and signposts where India needs to go to fully realize the potential of its 600 million female inhabitants. OPINION: Where have India's females gone?

      " The article discusses the high rates of crimes against women in India, including rape, assault, and cruelty, and the various factors that contribute to these statistics. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, every five minutes a woman in India is compelled to visit a police station and report a case of cruelty, every ten minutes she reports an assault, and every 21 minutes she reports a rape. However, the article notes that these numbers are likely underestimates, as many crimes go unreported due to various reasons such as fear, shame, and lack of support from the authorities.\n",
      "The article also highlights the gender gap in India, with women ranking low on various indicators of freedom, such as economic opportunities, educational attainment, and health and survival. The article suggests that this gap is due to decades of female infanticide, discrimination, and mistreatment of women, which begins even before they are born. The article also notes that marital rape is still not considered a crime in India, and that local governments and police are poorly equipped to process crimes against women.\n",
      "The article concludes by stating that the high rates of crimes against women in India are not surprising, given the societal attitudes towards women and the lack of support from the authorities. The article suggests that India needs to address these issues urgently to fully realize the potential of its 600 million female inhabitants.\n",

      "By . Sarah Griffiths . Spinal injury victims left paralysed have been offered new hope of walking again thanks to a breakthrough in stem cell science. U.S. scientists have regrown spinal cord neurons from a patient’s own cells for the first time. Implanting the cells in rats, they found that the neurons caused the animals’ nervous systems to rewire the spinal cord and brain. Scroll down for video . Spinal injury victims left paralysed (illustrated with a stock image) have been offered new hope of one day walking again, after U.S. scientists re-grew spinal cord neurons from a patient's own cells for the first time . Scientists took skin cells from an 86-year old man. They ‘wound the clock back’ so that the cells became stem cells again and were able to transform into any cell in the body. These stem cells were turned into neurons.They were injected into the spinal cords of paralysed . rats. In three months the neurons had made connections into the rats’ brains and along the length of their spinal cords. The new nerves extended into their limbs too. While this marks a scientific breakthrough, the rats were unable to walk again. The cells used to grow the neurons were taken from a healthy 86-year old man. They were converted into stem cell and then neurons. Researchers grafted the neurons into rats with spinal cord injuries that were two weeks old. They quickly formed tens of thousands of connections into the animal’s brain and along the spinal cord, according to the study published in Neuron. The connections extended out into the limbs of the injured rats’ limbs and bodies – ‘virtually the entire length of the animals’ central nervous system’. Mark Tuszynski, professor of neurosciences at the University of California, San Diego said that three months later the cells grafted ‘across long distances in the rats' spinal cords, even extending to the brain’ by ‘traversing wound tissues to penetrate and connect’. This image depicts extension of human nerve fibres into a rat's brain three months after spinal cord injury. Green fluorescent protein identifies human graft-derived nerve fibres, and red indicates host rat spinal cord white matter. Blue marks host rat grey matter . Lead scientist Dr Paul Lu of the university, said the human neurons ‘extended through the white matter of the injury sites, frequently penetrating adjacent grey matter to form synapses with rat neurons.’ ‘These findings indicate that intrinsic neuronal mechanisms readily overcome the barriers created by a spinal cord injury to extend many axons [nerve fibres] over very long distances, and that these capabilities persist even in neurons reprogrammed from very aged human cells.’ While the animals did not walk again, the experts still said they had made a breakthrough. And they believe that the build-up of scar tissue where the cells were implanted, could have prevented the rats from moving. Professor Tuszynski said: ‘Me and the team are now attempting to identify the most promising neural stem cell type for repairing spinal cord injuries. ‘We are trying to do as much as we possibly can to identify the best way of translating neural stem cell therapies for spinal cord injury to patients.’ For years the experts have been trying to find a way to prove that a spinal cord injury does not have to result in permanent dysfunction and paralysis. Scientists are so keen to use a patient’s own cells because they are more likely to be accepted by a person’s own body preventing them from having to stake strong immunosuppressant drugs for life. For years the expert has been trying to find a way to prove that a spinal cord injury results in permanent dysfunction and paralysis. Currently, there is no way to treat spinal injuries once connections between the neurons (illustrated) are lost, resulting in connections between the brain and the body being cut off . Currently, there is no way to treat spinal injuries once connections between the neurons are lost, resulting in connections between the brain and the body being cut off. Professor Tuszynski said : ‘Earlier work has shown that grafted stem cells reprogrammed to become neurons can, in fact, form new, functional circuits across an injury site, with the treated animals experiencing some restored ability to move affected limbs.’ However, he warned that further tests to find out how best to graft stem cells and cure paralysis could take ‘months to years’. He also said that experts should be cautious when conducting a human trial in the future. ‘The enormous outgrowth of axons [verve fibres] to many regions of the spinal cord and even deeply into the brain raises questions of possible harmful side effects if axons are mistargeted. ‘We need to learn if the new connections formed by axons are stable over time, and if implanted human neural stem cells are maturing on a human time frame – months to years – or more rapidly.’ [/INST]\n",

      "By . Tom Gardner . PUBLISHED: . 12:22 EST, 10 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:49 EST, 10 January 2014 . The families of two friends who vanished during a late-night fishing trip have asked people to pray for their safe return as divers prepare to comb a lake for their bodies. Detective searching for Mason Cox and David Wood, both 20, are baffled by their disappearance more than a week ago. They were last seen on Thursday January 2 before they headed to Lake Lanier in Dawsonville, Georgia, about 60 miles north of Atlanta. Mystery: David Wood, left, and Mason Cox, right, vanished on a late-night fishing trip . But their fishing equipment had been left behind and they both left personal belongings at Mr Cox's family home. Police have no evidence of foul play but have been using cadaver dogs, specially trained to follow the scent of bodies, to scour the area where they were last seen. Dawson County's Sheriff's Major Tony Wooten told DawsonNews.com: 'At this point, we don't suspect foul play. 'There's nothing other than that they got up to go fishing and at that point they haven't been seen since. We've got nothing to show that any foul play was involved.' Good friends: Friends and family said Mason Cox, left, and David Wood, right, would not have run away . At a press . conference today, both mothers reached out to their sons and spoke of their hope to see their safe return. Mason’s mother Leanne Cox said: 'My son . left his cellphone, his wallet, the shirt he was wearing that night — . it’s all in his room. His car is here. He’s just gone.' 'These are strong . kids. They are smart. Something stupid has just happened. Everybody is . here for you. Nothing is going to happen. If anything is wrong, don’t . worry, we’re here to support you. We’re here. 'We don't know what happened. It's like they just disappeared into thin air.' Ethelyn Geiger added: . 'David, Mason, if you can hear this, please call somebody. We’re very . worried about you. We just want to find our boys.' Relatives today posted an update on a Facebook page set up to keep friends and the public up to date with the search. Mr . Cox's brother wrote: 'Divers are going out today... We have been . waiting days for the ice to be break up and melt. Finally the Georgia . Bureau of Investigation and search and rescue team can get their . equipment in to survey the the bottom of lake lanier. 'Please pray for the best outcome, I again thank you all for your efforts and support in the search of my brother Mason Cox and David Wood.' Earlier the family posted a message vowing to hunt down those involved in the disappearance of their loved ones. It read: 'The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is finally involved to find my missing brother and his friend. To those who are ignorant, they did not run away and are not hiding. 'We will find those involved with the disappearance and punish them to the fullest extent their life has to offer.' Speaking a day after their disappearance, David Wood’s mother Ms Geiger told the Gainesville Times: 'David and Mason have been best friends for years. They are good boys. They did what normal 20-year-olds did. 'They went night fishing that morning and were supposed to come back and hang out with us for the day after New Year’s. They didn’t come back. We haven’t seen them since. We don’t know where they are.' [/INST]\n",

David and Rick Bremner from Milson, Shropshire, have scoured the globe looking for parts to rebuild the Bristol Scout Type-C plane once piloted by their grandfather, Francis Donald Holden Bremner. The pair have spent out over £100,000 since they found three small parts  in his shed following his death in 1983 and have finally completed the reconstruction this week. The rebuilt Bristol Scout Type C airfcraft, which was flown between 1914 and 1916 by David and Rick Bremner's grandfather Francis . Their grandfather Francis Donald Holden Bremner in Thasos in 1916 with one of the seven Bristol Scout Type C biplane he flew . Flight sub-lieutenant Francis Donald Holden Bremner (left), in 1915, and his grandson David Bremner (right), 63, who took on the task . Flight Sub Lieutenant Bremner had flown the plane between 1914 and 1918 while serving with the Royal Naval Air Service during the Gallipoli campaign. On his return from battle the war hero had always told his family he would like to see the aircraft take to the skies once again. To honour their late grandfather's wishes David, 63, and Rick, 61, along with friend and amateur pilot Theo Willford, 66, began looking for the other components that would complete the aircraft. Starting with just a joystick, rudder bar and magneto - an electrical generator which uses magnets - found in the shed the trio have travelled the world looking for the rest of the parts - many no longer in existence - including the engine, which was purchased in New Zealand. After a staggering 10,000 hours of building the plane from scratch, this week they put the final touches to the aircraft, which has a wingspan of 24ft and is 20ft in length. It is due to take the skies in spring next year and the trio plan to fly it over the River Somme on July 1, 2016, marking exactly 100 years since the fateful day in 1916 when almost 20,000 British soldiers lost their lives in France.

Theo Willford lays out the wing structure during its restoration (left) and the grip of the plane's joystick which had to be repaired (right) Some of the plane's original parts, including the stick, rubber and magneto (left), which David (right) found after his grandfather's death . The trio are celebrating this week after completing the restoration of the plane and plan to take it to the skies for the first time in spring . It will be the only flyable Bristol Scout Type-C anywhere in the world when it finally takes off. David, who works as a mechanical engineer and is chairman of the British Microlight Aircraft Association, said he believed his grandfather would be proud. He said: 'We grew up less than 10 miles from my grandfather in Kent so we heard all his war stories. 'Although he talked about flying a lot he had never mentioned keeping these parts before. 'When we found them we knew they belonged to his favourite plane because the magneto was made by Bosch, the German company. 'Back in those days it was very hard to get German parts obviously, but my grandfather had told us the story of how he traded a few bombs and some food to a French base in return for the Bosch magneto. 'So these parts came from that plane and it would make sense that he would keep hold of them because it was his favourite aircraft he had flown. 'He said one day he would like to see it fly again over British skies.' The brother's have spent over £10,000 on the plane and wanted to rebuilt it as a tribute to their grandfather who died in 1983 . The aircraft will be the only flyable Bristol Scout Type-C anywhere in the world when it finally takes off. David is pictured with his wife Susan Bremner and the plane, which he says his grandfather would have been 'proud' of . These three pieces of the plane were discovered when David and his father, Ian, 91, were clearing out Francis' workshop, following his death in 1983. They quickly realised they had found the part which provides a spark for the engine, from the pilot's beloved No.1264 aircraft. But it was not until Mr Willford, a fellow amateur pilot, encouraged the family to start rebuilding the plane that the project came about. In 2002, the trio began researching where they could find appropriate parts to start rebuilding the plane before work began in 2010. David, a grandfather-of-two, added: 'We had the parts for years and had the idea in the back of our minds that one day we would try to rebuild the plane. 'But it was Theo who actually got us to make a start. 'We started researching what the plane would look like and because the parts don't exist anymore we had to plan what replacements we could still get now. 'The three original bits we had only probably made up about two per cent of the whole thing, so there was so much left to do. 'The only thing we didn't make ourselves was the engine, which we got from a New Zealand-based company and it's is an actual 1917 engine in a beautiful condition. One of the Bristol Scouts crashed on the island of Imbros in Turkey, which is now officially known as Gökçeada, in March 1916 . 'The aircraft is pretty much finished now apart from the petrol tank and the fabric covering the fuselage. 'Rick and I live in Shropshire but Theo lives in Dorset, so we took small things down to him and then brought them back in a trailer when he was working on it. 'I think our grandfather would be proud of us re-building his favourite plane, but he'd probably say we've spent far too much time and money on it as well.' Sub-lieutenant Holden, nicknamed 'Bunnie' because he was always twitching his nose, was in active service between, throughout the whole of the First World War. After the war he worked as a patents engineer in Brasted, Kent and lived with his wife Vivyen, and two sons, Christopher, and Ian - Rick and David's father. During 1916, Officer Holden had been stationed on the islands of Imbros and Thasos in the Aegean Sea as part of the Royal Naval Air Service, and flew seven Bristol Scout Type-C planes. His favourite plane of the seven had Serial No. 1264 and he kept three small parts of that aircraft in his workshop until he died aged 89. Rick, a builder and father-of-two from Tenbury Wells, added: 'It's been a huge privilege to be part of this project. It's just fantastic. 'We all just wish my grandfather was here to answer a lot of questions we have about details of the plane, because he could have told us straight away. 'We have old photos of what the plane should look like, but when you try to zoom in to look a specific details, it's too grainy to make out. 'But fortunately we got there in the end - its been a long old labour of love but it's been worth it. 'I think its a fitting tribute to my grandad and other British pilots who battled so valiantly for us during the Great War.' Flight sub-lieutenant Francis Bremner, nicknamed 'Bunnie' can be seen in the seat of the Bristol Scout on Thasos, Greece, in June 1916 . This is the map that Francis Bremner used to fly 89 miles across water from Imbors to Thasos. Most if it was out of sight with no radio and an unreliable compass . The Bristol Scout was a single-engine, single-seat fighter intended to supply ground commanders with an advantageous 'eye in the sky'. The initial prototype, Scout A, was unveiled in 1913 with a top speed of 100 miles per hour, a service ceiling of 14,000 feet and an endurance of 2.5 hours. Its design was regarded as very streamlined and consisted of a well-contoured fuselage with the single rotary piston engine set to the front and a conventional tail to the rear. The engine powered a two-bladed wooden propeller and the open air cockpit was held just under and aft of the upper wing assembly with generally adequate views. The Scout B was established as an early militarised form and led to the development of the Scout C – which was the one flown by the Bremner's grandfather. Type C aircraft was first ordered by the British government on November 5, 1914, in a 12 aircraft production batch for the Royal Flying Corps. In was later commissioned by the competing Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) in a 24-aircraft batch and its first combat was in February 1915. It was armed with a standardised mounting and a 7.7mm Lewis machine gun along the left side of the fuselage away from the spinning propeller arc. Some were also finished with their guns fielded across the upper wing assembly. Its targets ranged from enemy aircraft (patrol, escort, interception), bombers, observation balloons, ground-based 'targets of opportunity' and even Zeppelins, which regularly patrolled airspaces. The C type Scout was followed by Scout D in November 1915, when 210 aircraft were produced. Source: Military Factory . [/INST]\n",

      "Editor's note: Thomas Maier is the author of \"The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings,\" (Basic Books), which was the basis of a Warner Bros. video documentary released in November. He is a reporter for Newsday. Thomas Maier says Ted Kennedy's immigrant heritage helped drive his advocacy of a more open America. (CNN) -- With a sign from Dunganstown, Ireland, hanging in his U.S. Capitol office, a reminder of the famine-ravished farm where his ancestors began, Sen. Edward \"Ted\" Kennedy always seemed to understand that the Kennedys were perhaps America's greatest immigrant story -- overcoming religious, ethnic and cultural barriers to reach once unimaginable heights. \"My brother Jack wrote 'A Nation of Immigrants' in 1958, and his words ring true as clearly today as they did half a century ago,\" said Ted early last year, a few months before he was struck with a malignant brain tumor that claimed his life Tuesday. \"I'm constantly reminded of my immigrant heritage.\" Indeed, the Kennedys' vision of \"A Nation of Immigrants\" -- which Ted championed throughout his public career -- dramatically transformed today's America, opening the door for millions of new citizens and paving the way for Barack Obama's presidency. It is the Kennedys' most lasting legacy. John F. Kennedy's idealistic belief in America's dream of opportunity for all was clearly stated in \"A Nation of Immigrants,\" which reflected so much of his family's story as Irish Catholic immigrants. The essence of this little known, little-studied book became the 1965 Immigration Reform Act, which ended the discriminatory preference given to white Europeans and opened the door to millions from Latin America, Asia, Africa and around the world. First proposed by President Kennedy in July 1963, a few months before his assassination, the bill was passed in his memory, pushed by his two brothers in the U.S. Senate and signed by President Lyndon Johnson beneath the Statue of Liberty. Ted was particularly proud of its passage and referred to it often in public. No law in our lifetime has done more to change the demographics of modern America. Many historians routinely ignore, or give only a passing nod, to the underlying forces of ethnicity and religion that so often influenced the Kennedy family's actions and outlook. Often their years in power were lionized as \"Camelot\" by the press. But as Ted Kennedy realized, a comparison to British royalty hardly seemed proper for the great-grandson of an Irish migrant worker who fled from a Dunganstown, County Wexford, farm during the Great Famine. That Dunganstown sign in Ted's office was a reminder of the Kennedys' sense of their own immigrant heritage, their epic encounters with religious bigotry, and how the complex dynamics of their family life reflected the Irish Catholic experience in America. From his grandfather, former Boston Mayor John F. \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald, young Ted heard of the great wave of Irish immigrants to America that included their family. And in the 1990s, the efforts of Ted and his sister, U.S. Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith, to bring peace to their ancestral homeland seemed to reflect their deeper sense of being Irish, of being Catholic and of being members of a family coming from an often oppressed immigrant minority. Ted went back to Ireland many times, including to the old Kennedy homestead in Dunganstown. The culmination of this Kennedy's immigrant legacy was most apparent by the 2008 presidential campaign, which offered many reminders for Ted Kennedy of the barriers his brother faced in 1960, becoming the first U.S. president from a minority background. Most notably, Obama, the U.S. senator from Illinois, possessed a style and dignity particularly reminiscent of the Kennedy era. At a key moment in the primary campaign, Ted Kennedy publicly supported Obama who, in turn, said the Kennedy family always stood for \"what is best about America.\" Obama's campaign faced many tests similar to those that John Kennedy endured in 1960 as the first and only Roman Catholic elected to the presidency. As a minority, born to black and white parents, Obama had to overcome code words and subtle biases historically applied to African-Americans. Like Catholic hard-liners who complained that Kennedy wasn't \"Catholic enough\" in 1960, Obama was sometimes criticized within the black community for not seeming \"black enough\" in 2008. And yet when the media made it seem Obama had been attacked for his minority status, African-Americans rallied to his support, just as Catholics did in 1960 for Kennedy. Ted Kennedy's dramatic embrace of Obama's candidacy carried a powerful symbolism, one of the last significant acts of his distinguished career before he fell ill. From the broadest vantage, the Kennedy story reminds us of the glories and the limits of America's melting pot and those histories that paint people from minority groups in familiar \"just like us\" tones. We gain a better grasp of the Kennedys' appeal beyond Irish Catholics -- to countless other immigrant and minority groups who share a dream of ascendancy in America. In this context, our understanding of the Kennedys becomes richer, more complex and of greater historical significance to what John Kennedy called a nation of immigrants. It recalls how far we've progressed as a country since the 1960 election, and yet how many barriers still remain today. No one understood that better than Ted Kennedy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Maier. [/INST]\n",

      " The article discusses the significance of Ted Kennedy's immigrant heritage in shaping his advocacy for a more open and inclusive America. The author, Thomas Maier, notes that Kennedy's ancestors were Irish immigrants who faced religious and ethnic discrimination, and that this experience influenced Kennedy's understanding of the importance of immigration and diversity. Maier highlights how Kennedy's belief in the \"Nation of Immigrants\" concept, which was first proposed by his brother John F. Kennedy in 1958, transformed American immigration policy and paved the way for Barack Obama's presidency. The author also notes that Kennedy's support for Obama's 2008 presidential campaign was a symbol of the Kennedy family's commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion. Overall, the article argues that the Kennedy family's immigrant heritage has played a significant role in shaping their political views and their commitment to promoting a more inclusive and diverse America.\n",

      "By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 11:56 EST, 18 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:44 EST, 11 April 2013 . Attack: One-time TV dad of the year Keith Preddie could face jail after he admitted attacking his wife . A former television dad of the year is facing jail after he admitted attacking his wife in a row over Christmas presents. Michael Jackson impersonator and father of three Keith Preddie, 44, threw a clothes horse and a plastic step at his wife Emma before pinning her to a sofa at their home in Croydon last December. Preddie, who was awarded the title of Britain's Best Dad by GMTV in 2010, gave a long pause before breaking down in tears as he admitted assault by beating at Croydon Magistrates' Court today. Chairman of the Bench Jackie Hamblin warned Preddie he could face a spell behind bars as she adjourned the hearing for sentence next month. The performer, who wore a black suit with a white shirt and a black tie, appeared tearful throughout the hearing and was supported in court by around 15 well-wishers. Preddie was Britain's original Michael Jackson impersonator, first taking on the role of the King of Pop in 1986 and going on to perform his routine on stage and screen. He has also worked for the Family Centre in New Addington, which offers support services for local families, for the past decade. It was his work to set up an It's Time For Dad's support group at the centre that saw him crowned Britain's Best Dad by GMTV three years ago. The court heard details of Preddie's assault on his wife at the family home in Croydon, footage of which was captured on a CCTV camera at the house. Prosecutor Louise Thomas told the court how a row flared on the morning of December 18 last year after Preddie marched in to the back room of the family home where his wife was wrapping Christmas presents. 'Mr Preddie entered the room and asked her if there were any presents left over that he could give his mother,' she said. 'Mrs Preddie replied she had already given his mother a present. 'At that point Mr Preddie became angry, he shouted that he had been to a lot of shops to get a present for his mother and he got very stressed during the day looking for one.' Ms Thomas told magistrates how Mrs Preddie warned her husband she would only speak to him if he calmed down. But his anger only worsened. 'Suddenly he grabbed a washing frame which had clothing on it and he threw it at her. It landed about a foot away from her,' she said. Tears: Preddie, who has been a Michael Jackson impersonator for almost 30 years, broke down in court as he admitted assault by beating before magistrates in Croydon today . 'At that point she told him he had better calm down and grow up so he left the room. 'After a short time he re-entered the room and started shouting again. He then threw a plastic step at Mrs Preddie hitting her on her left arm,' the prosecutor said. The court was told how Mrs Preddie told her husband to get out of the room. Ms Thomas said: 'At that point she walked straight up to him and then she suddenly found herself pinned down by both arms. 'Each of the defendant's hands holding each arm. She was pinned down lying against the sofa. She shouted \"Get off me, leave me alone\". 'He then let go and she left the room. The argument caused such a commotion that it woke up their daughter,' she said. Notoriety: Preddie appeared on an episode of Come Dine With Me and was named Britain's Best Dad by GMTV in 2010 . Ms Thomas told how Mrs Preddie contacted police the following day, having already spoken to a domestic violence shelter. She added: 'On the morning of December 20 she told Mr Preddie that she had called the police and he said he knew what he had done was wrong and apologised.' After the hearing Ms Thomas explained that CCTV footage of the assault obtained by police had come . from a camera inside the house. No explanation was given as to why there . was a camera present. She also said pictures taken by Ms Preddie showed bruising to her left arm. Adjourning the hearing for sentence on April 11, Ms Hamblin said: 'The report that we will request is an all options report. That could include custody. 'We note that this offence was committed in a domestic setting and had an effect on your daughter, who was in the house. 'We found greater harm because of the sustained nature of the attack.' Preddie has appeared on an episode of the Channel 4 reality show Come Dine With Me, which saw him annoying his fellow contestants by repeatedly parroting Jacko's 'Shamone' catchphrase. He later released a pop single named Shamone, which entered the music charts in Germany. Preddie was bailed to return to the court on April 11 for sentence, when the court will also hear an application for costs and a restraining order. He was ordered not to contact his ex-wife and will only be allowed back to his old family home while accompanied by police to collect his belongings. [/INST]\n",

Reclining in the water with his feet raised in the air this grizzly bear cub bears an uncanny resemblance to one of the Jungle Book's best-loved characters. The cub, who took a dip in the river after fishing with his mother and siblings, looked a lot like Baloo  the bear as he floated in the water. The chilled out grizzly was captured on camera by Canadian photographer Patrick Roque, while he was on a trip to British Columbia in Canada. The bear cub reclining in the water with his feet raised in the air after a hard day of fishing with his family . The bear has an uncanny resemblance to Jungle Book character Baloo as he floats down the river . Mr Roque of Alberta said: 'This particular cub had just finished wrestling with one of his siblings and suddenly decided to sit and rest. 'As the cub was sitting he leaned back a bit too far and rolled onto his back. 'Then, he began playing with its paws, as if he was trying to pretend that it was all part of the plan!' The 50-year-old managed to get just 150 metres from the family of bears as he sat in a small boat and spent approximately four hours taking pictures of them while they fished for their dinner. He added: 'I felt amused and entertained while I photographed the cub. But, more importantly, I felt extremely fortunate to be able to witness and document the moment. The chilled out bear was captured on camera by Canadian photographer Patrick Roque in British Columbia . The grizzly bear is listed as threatened in the United States and endangered in parts of Canada . 'Most of people that view my work are wildlife enthusiasts, and they seem to appreciate the images with the same admiration and respect that I have for these amazing animals. 'Typically, the bears are less concerned about boats than they are with people on land. 'This is likely to be because they know they can easily escape into the forest. The photographer managed to get just 150 metres from the family of bears as he sat in a small boat . 'When you eliminate that escape route, the animal is forced into a defensive mode and typically gets aggressive. 'Unfortunately, due to bear poaching as well as government permitted Trophy Bear hunting in British Columbia, I cannot be more specific regarding the areas in which my photographs are taken.'

      "By . John Stevens . Created: 18 July 2011 | Updated: 13 December 2013 . Tragic: Ronni Chasen, 64, was shot dead in her car as she drove home through Beverly Hills . A glamorous Hollywood publicist who was gunned down as she drove home from a movie premiere died from a shot to the heart, her autopsy has revealed. Ronni Chasen, 64, was driving home from a showing of Burlesque when her Mercedes-Benz came under attack on Sunset Boulevard by a gunman with a stolen policeman's pistol on November 16. She was hit four times, the report said, including 'the most rapidly fatal' shot, which pierced her heart, then passed through the right-side pulmonary vein and the right lung. A toxicology test found no signs of alcohol or drugs in her system. The main suspect in the case, Harold Smith, committed suicide in the . lobby of a Hollywood apartment building when police approached him more . than three weeks after the slaying to question him. Initially, rumours swirled around Hollywood that Ms Chasen had been targeted in a professional hit. But police later claimed the crime scene was consistent with an attempted robbery or road rage. Ms Chasen’s car was found with its window cracked open a few inches. Police believe that Smith, a 43-year-old ex-convict, shot Ms Chasen. He shot himself dead on December 1 in a Santa Monica apartment building after being confronted by officers. The report revealed that the gun, . which was used in both shootings, was a revolver stolen from a police . officer during a burglary in the San Fernando Valley. Final hours: The evening before her brutal murder, Chasen, far right, arrived on the red carpet at the Burlesque premiere to support a client . Smash: Chasen was still breathing immediately after the crash, according to the first witnesses to reach her . Removed: Ms Chasen's damaged Mercedes Benz was towed away from Sunset Boulevard . Suspect: Harold Smith had been convicted for weapons and drugs charges . It is unclear what department that officer works for and when the weapon was stolen. The investigation concluded that it was unlikely that Ms Chasen had been killed in a professional hit. It . said that a professional would likely have used a more powerful weapon . and the hit would have been in a more remote location. The gunman also hit Ms Chasen in the shoulder and chest, rather than in a tight pattern. Ms Chasen received no death threats, was involved in no legal battles and seemed to live a ‘normal life’. The veteran publicist was driving her Mercedes Benz just after midnight on November 16 when she was shot in the chest, leading her car to smash into a light pole. Ms Chasen had just attended the premiere and after-party for the new movie starring Cher and Christina Aguilera. She lived in Westwood, some 10 miles away, and may have been driving home when the attack occurred. The publicist ran her own public relations and marketing firm, Chasen & Co and was well known in the industry. She had worked as a publicist since 1973 with high-profile films on her resume like 1989's Driving Miss Daisy and 1994's Lolita. Grim: The LA county coroner removes Smith's body. Police confirmed the shooting was suicide using CCTV tapes . Apartment: Smith refused to surrender to officers and then pulled out a gun and shot himself in the head . She also did work for the Cocoon and Rocky franchises as well as Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. She was named senior vice president of worldwide publicity at MGM in 1993. MGM . executive Ashley Boone called Ms Chasen, 'One of the most respected . publicity executives in the business' with 'strength and expertise in . developing, positioning and executing productive motion picture . campaigns'.

      "A congressman and his wife have reunited two-year-old twin girls who were living in separate homes by adopting them into their own family. Oklahoma congressman Markwayne Mullin told NewsOK that he was hesitant at first to expand his brood of three to five, but his wife convinced him otherwise. Now, little Ivy and Lynette - who were born into 'kind of a bad situation' - are fully integrated into the Mullin family and they 'could not be happier,' says the congressman. Happy family: Oklahoma congressman Markwayne Mullin and his wife Christie have reunited two-year-old twin girls who were living in separate homes (bottom right) by adopting them into their own family . Grinning girls: Ivy (left) and Lynette (right) were living with distant, elderly relations of Mrs Mullin, in separate homes, before they were adopted on August 21 . Before the adoption was approved on August 21, the blonde twins were living with distant relations of Mr Mullin's wife Christie, in separate but 'very loving' homes. But the relatives, a grandmother and great aunt, had told Mrs Mullin that they hoped they'd live long enough to see the girls graduate. The congressman's wife approached him several times about adopting the girls, but he told her it was a huge time commitment, and they already had their hands full with two sons, nine and eight, and a five-year-old girl. He suggested he write a check, telling her 'it's easier sometimes to give money than it is to give time.' Seeking guidance: The congressman, who himself is the youngest of seven, said: '[God] opened our hearts to the idea of adoption' (pictured with wife Christie, sons Jim and Andrew, and daughter Larra) But then Mrs Mullin pulled what her husband calls the 'trump card'. She asked him: 'Would you pray about it?' 'How do you pray about that?' said Congressman Mullin at a town meeting in Henryetta, Oklahoma, last week. Politician parent: Republican Markwayne Mullin, 36, is the U.S. Representative for Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district . 'I mean, really. \"Hey Lord, would you please, please make her heart as selfish as mine\"?' So instead he prayed that God would change his own mind, 'And man did He ever,' he says. The Congressman, who himself is the youngest of seven, told TheHill: 'Our family prayed for God's will and He opened our hearts to the idea of adoption. 'We were unsure about whether, at this time, we could handle the extra responsibility,' he added. 'But God's timing is always perfect.' Now the congressman - who is part of the Cherokee nation, just like his twin girls - says Lynette and Ivy have taught him more than he ever expected. 'People say, \"Man, you're going to be . such a blessing to those girls,\"' he said at the town meeting. 'And I'm going to tell you right now - if you're someone . who's thinking about adoption - you're going to be blessed more by them . than you will ever be a blessing to them.' As for the girls themselves, they have apparently been doing well since being reunited. 'If you talk to anybody, they say twins . need to be together. The bond between them is just amazing,' said Congressman Mullin. 'They can . have a conversation with each other for hours and nobody else can . understand it,' he added. Loving couple: Congressman Mullin has been married to his high school sweetheart Christie for 16 years . Home sweet home: Congressman Mullin and his wife Christie live in Oklahoma with their five children . Congressman Mullin has been married to his wife and high school sweetheart Christie for 16 years. When he was just 20, he and his wife took over his family's plumbing business after his father fell ill, and they struggled through financial troubles with just six employees. Now, Mullin Plumbing is well-recognized in the area and proudly employs over 100 Oklahomans. On his campaign website, the congressman describes himself as: 'an eastern Oklahoma native, successful businessman, rancher, family man and youth leader in his church.' In a statement, the father-of-five said: 'The new Mullin seven look forward to all that life has to offer our family!' [/INST]\n",

      " Oklahoma Congressman Markwayne Mullin and his wife Christie have adopted two-year-old twin girls, Ivy and Lynette, who were living in separate homes. The girls were born into a difficult situation, but are now fully integrated into the Mullin family. The congressman was initially hesitant to expand their brood of three to five, but his wife convinced him otherwise. The girls were living with distant relatives of Mrs. Mullin, but the relatives told her they hoped to live long enough to see the girls graduate. The congressman suggested writing a check instead of adopting the girls, but his wife approached him several times about adopting them. The congressman prayed about it and God opened their hearts to the idea of adoption. The Mullins are now the proud parents of five children, and the twins have brought joy and love into their lives. The congressman says that adopting the girls has taught him more than he expected, and that they have brought a special bond to their family.\n",

      "(CNN) -- Imagine a smoke-filled jazz club, dark and crowded. The sounds of a trumpet solo echo on stage, while a piano, bass and drums pound out a finger-snapping groove. You can almost smell the cigarette smoke, taste the cheap booze being served. This is Berlin, 1939 -- the eve of World War II. These are the Hot Time Swingers, the imagined jazz band at the center of Esi Edugyan's \"Half-Blood Blues.\" The novel was a finalist for Britain's prestigious Man Booker prize in 2011 and reaches U.S. bookstores this week. The story is told through the eyes of the Swingers' bass player, Sid Griffiths, in alternating takes between events in Paris and Berlin in 1939 and Baltimore and Berlin in 1992. The novel captures the end of the jazz age in Germany perfectly in the characters' staccato slang, sounding much like jazz music imagined as dialogue. Offstage, the story captures the paranoia and fear of the days leading up to the start of the war, and the racial tension of the time period. Sid narrates, but the band's brilliant young trumpet player, Hieronymus \"Hiero\" Falk, is the linchpin of the story, a German who happens to be black. Hiero's prodigy-like talent brings the band success, love and rivalries among its members. After being banned by the Nazis as \"degenerate\" music, the Swingers escape to Paris, where they meet Louis Armstrong. But then war breaks out, and the Gestapo arrests Hiero in a cafÃ©. He is never heard from again. Jump ahead 50 years. Falk has become a cult hero among jazz fans. He's now the subject of a documentary film. Sid and the only other surviving band member, Chip Jones, are invited to the film's premiere in Berlin. As they return to celebrate their long-lost friend, Sid, the only witness to Hiero's disappearance, is forced to reveal a decades-old secret. \"Half-Blood Blues\" is the second novel from Edugyan, an author with a bit of a globe-hopping past. She was born and raised in Canada, the daughter of immigrant parents from Ghana. She has studied and lived in the United States and across Europe, including stops in Iceland, Spain and Germany. Now married and mother to an infant daughter, Edugyan lives in Victoria, British Columbia. CNN recently asked her about the novel in a phone interview and via e-mail. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: What was the spark behind your book? Edugyan: I was living in Germany at the time, acutely aware of my difference -- being a black woman from Canada. At the same time I'd been reading about the so-called \"Rhineland Bastards\" -- the half-black children of France's colonial soldiers from Africa stationed in the Rhineland after the close of the first World War. I began imagining their lives in Germany, as both outsiders and insiders, and this naturally led to my wondering what must have happened to them during the 1930s, with the rise of Nazism. This is where my interest in the novel came from. But the book itself more rightly begins with Sid's voice, his character, the perplexing problems of loyalty and betrayal in any artistic life. CNN: You really captured the feel, the language and the tone of the late 1930s European jazz scene. Did you research this period extensively before you started writing? Edugyan: Thank you, that's kind of you to say. I researched assiduously, both before and during the writing, to capture the feel of that world. But Sid's voice is so very particular to Sid himself that I would never want it to stand in as some sort of \"representative\" voice from that time. It's an approximation of the kind of hybrid language he and his band mates were speaking at the time. But it's important to remember, too, that Sid is a man straddling two eras -- 1930s Europe and 1990s Baltimore -- and the shifts in his rhythms, diction, syntax hopefully capture some of that flavor. CNN: I pictured you listening to a lot of jazz from this time period while you were writing. Did you and were there any jazz artists in particular that inspired you? Edugyan: It's interesting to hear you say so. The music was my constant companion, even more than books. Not only as a way to lead me back into the novel after each break but also as a kind of consolation. There was a strength and faith and promise in it that I think I needed at the time. What's fascinating to me now is to think back on who I was listening to at various points in the novel and read the book with that in mind. Not only the language itself, but the speed and emotion under the prose finds a corollary in the music. Or so it seems to me in retrospect. Among the artists I listened to most often were Sidney Bechet, Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong. CNN: Your novel focuses on the Nazi persecution of the Afro-German community. What drew you to this little known chapter of pre-World War II history? Edugyan: As the Canadian-born daughter of Ghanaian immigrants, I grew up between worlds, in a sense, aware both of my differences and kinships. Loyalties were always mixed, and the world inside the walls of my home was significantly different from the world beyond it. I did my graduate work at Johns Hopkins, living in Baltimore for a short time, which reinforced this complicated sense of identity. And in the years since, I lived on and off in Europe, where, as ever, I had periods of feeling profoundly at home and periods of total estrangement. I think that sense of uprootedness, that quiet seeking after identity and self, lies at the heart of this novel. ... In the writing itself, you're not thinking about such things. You just know that there's a story there, one you want told. And you run with it. CNN: While Sid narrates the novel, this really felt like Hiero's story to me. He's such a compelling character but remains something of an enigma. I assume this was by design? Edugyan: Absolutely. That unknowability lies at the core of the novel. It seemed it would have been an act of extraordinary presumption to take Hiero's voice, to speak for him, to fill that silence. And, too, a way of diminishing the sadness of what he (and his real-life counterparts) suffered. CNN: You come from such an interesting background, the child of Ghanaian Ã©migrÃ© parents, born and raised in Canada. You've studied in a number of countries, including the U.S. and Europe. You now live in British Columbia. How has all that world travel influenced you as an artist and a person? Edugyan: ... There can be something liberating ... for the fiction writer who finds herself caught between worlds. An opportunity to observe and inhabit the skins of others. I know, for myself, that all of that traveling has impacted the kinds of stories I am drawn to. CNN: You're also the mother of a young child. Has that changed your approach to writing? Edugyan: Oh, it's still so early to tell -- our daughter is only 6 months old. But that, too, is turning out to be a different kind of journey. CNN: What's next for you? Edugyan: I find myself staring out the windows an awful lot these days, dreaming up the next book. But our daughter fills up the immediate hours of the day.

      "By . Katy Winter . PUBLISHED: . 06:58 EST, 26 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:59 EST, 26 September 2013 . Claire Danes may have scooped the award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category for her role in Homeland at this years 65th Primetime Emmys, but it was her hair that caused the biggest storm when she stepped onto the red carpet. With her usually shoulder length locks seemingly chopped into a soft bob, the 34-year-old actress revealed to E! read carpet presenter Ryan Seacrest that her crop was in fact fake. Rather than committing to a haircut, the actress had her hair carefully styled into a ‘fob’, or faux bob, and here Femail shows you how to copy this chic style. Keep your hair on! Homeland's Claire Danes pulls hair fake-out with 'faux bob' when she hit the red carpet at the 65th Primetime Emmys on Monday . Claire, who won the award fro Best Actress in a Drama Series this year (left) for her role as a troubled CIA agent in Homeland, sported a much longer hair do at last years Emmys (right) Celebrity hair dresser Errol Douglas MBE, who has worked with the likes of Diana Ross, Brad Pitt, Barbra Streisand, and supermodels Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, shows us how. Errol said of Claire’s red carpet look: ‘The bob is a classic – it's the fast track to elegant and a great way to show off high gloss healthy locks, it's age versatile and there's an interpretation that works for all face shapes and hair colours. ‘It's an iconic look and will always work for the timeless glamour we like to see on the red carpet.  I love that Claire Danes rocked the fake.’ Errol says that the right tools and preparation are essential for Femail readers hoping to create the perfect ‘fob’ Where you are after a 'fob' or a full-on bob, Errol says make sure you get the right style for you. 'Ask what length overall and type of fringe or not will suit your face . shape, age and lifestyle. 'A longer version with soft fringe will be . easier to maintain and easier to wear. Do ask also about colour . choices, particularly on blonde tones, as they need to match skin tones . which change with age, just to ensure they flatter and don't appear . harsh. 'Ask about the amount of layers cut into a bob – too many results . in a loss of shape and the hair kicks OUT instead of IN which is the . signature look of a bob. 'Finally, the the minimum length of a bob I . feel for best flattering features should be to the jaw line, anything . above is quite difficult to pull off and isn't for everyone' He says: 'After a barrel brush blow dry to really smooth out all of the hair, use pins to literally mould the hair and push it underneath itself, rolled almost to the desired bob length. ‘Faking on longer hair in this way creates a natural vintage movement with the thickness of the hair once it's doubled up on itself. Use Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream to mould (use on wet hair before the blow dry) and Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray to set without stiffness.' 'A smooth, healthy, high shine finish is the key to all interpretations of the bob, so product preparation and the right styling tools are essential. Build in moisture before a barrel brush blow dry with Morocanoil Original Treatment applied from mid length to ends. 'Once dry, finish with a heated styling tool that locks in moisture and delivers shine. My Treat&Style has built in Keratin Capsules to infuse a shot of the hair's naturally produced protein, visible on the finish. Use a non-sticky spray to finish that allows movement.' The mother-of-one arrived as a nominee in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category for her role in Homeland, but the star left as a winner. Claire Danes appeared at the Showtime Primetime Emmy's Eve Party on Saturday with her normal long blonde locks . She also stunned on the red carpet, wearing an Armani Privé couture lace gown with a neckline slashed down to the navel, paired with subtle Neil Lane jewellery and Christian Louboutin shoes. However some critics thought the actress looked too skinny, drawing attention to her jutting collar bones and flat chest. Claire may have faked hers, but there was no doubt that bobs were as on trend as pale pastel dresses on the red carpet this year. Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery's bob was sleek and side-parted, while Giuliana Rancic added edge to her chic bob with a bias cut and Jane Krakowski softened hers with layers and a sweeping fringe. Errol says: Michelle Dockery's smooth, glossy, side-parted version brought great class to her overall look.' January Jones also opted for a short cut, though with a curled tousled look, which was also adopted by Julianne Hough and fellow Man Men star Christina Hendricks. Michelle Dockery Giuliana Rancic and Jane Krakowski (L-R) kept it sleek and elegant . Julianne Hough and January Jones and Christina Hendricks (L-R) all chose to keep their bobs tousled . [/INST]\n",

      " Actress Claire Danes stunned at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards by sporting a \"faux bob\" on the red carpet, rather than a real one. Celebrity hairdresser Errol Douglas explained that a \"fob\" is a classic look that can add elegance and show off healthy locks. He demonstrated how to create the perfect \"fob\" using the right tools and preparation.\n",
      "Danes' usual long blonde locks were chopped into a soft bob for the awards ceremony, but it was revealed that the style was actually fake. The actress had her hair styled into a \"fob\" using a barrel brush blow dry and pins to mould the hair and push it underneath itself. This created a natural vintage movement with the thickness of the hair once it's doubled up on itself.\n",
      "The \"fob\" is a versatile look that can suit all face shapes and hair colors. It's important to ask the right questions when getting a bob, such as the length overall, fringe, color, and amount of layers. A longer version with a soft fringe is easier to maintain and wear, and it's important to choose a color that matches skin tones.\n",
      "Other celebrities also rocked the bob look on the red carpet, including Michelle Dockery, Giuliana Rancic, Jane Krakowski, Julianne Hough, and Christina Hendricks. Their styles ranged from sleek and side-parted to tousled and curled.\n",
      "In conclusion, the \"fob\" is a timeless and elegant look that can add glamour to any red carpet appearance. With the right preparation and styling tools, anyone can achieve this classic look.\n",
